    summary:
      I have a love for learning new things that I believe can help me be successful in life. I've been in the logistics industry for 7 years and would like a new challenge.
      I believe that coding is a challenge that I'm ready for and can succeed in. I love to grow and improve myself every year. I see this as an opportunity to do just that.
      There's a lot of upside in this field and I would love to be a part of it.
