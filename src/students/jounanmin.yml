    summary: |
      "My career until now has been choatic, fun and challenging. I have been able to learn from different companies how to become a
      well rounded individual. My love of learning has pulled me into different directions now leading up to learning how to code, build websites and possibly change the world.
      I have been able to adapt in very different positions, from managing a fast food resturant with over 75 employees, to handling over 100
      catastrophe cases in different states and learning how to exercise empathy. Now I am learning how to write computer code and be able to build a dream to reality.
      In the next 6 months I believe to acquire a junior developer position in a kick ass company.
