/**
 * SpanContext represents Span state that must propagate to descendant Spans

 * SpanContext is logically divided into two pieces: the user-level "Baggage"
 * (see setBaggageItem and getBaggageItem) that propagates across Span
 * boundaries and any Tracer-implementation-specific fields that are needed to
 * identify or otherwise contextualize the associated Span instance (e.g., a
 * <trace_id, span_id, sampled> tuple).
