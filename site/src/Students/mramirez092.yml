  summary: 
      Since I was in school I learned something basic about html. Now, at the age of 18, I decided to start and take programming further. 
      
      I am very grateful to 4Geeks because thanks to them I have the motivation and dedication to learn more every day.

      Opening my computer every day and starting to practice and try new things is something that has led me to learn more about this whole world.

      I think I have found something that I really like and that I want to develop a lot so that tomorrow I can be a great professional in Full Stack and much more!
