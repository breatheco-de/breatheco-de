    summary: |
      I enjoy both outdoor activities and indoor hobbies such as watching
      films and spending time on the computer.
      I was a professional sourdough bread baker for a few years, and after
      that, I decided to make a big change. I have had an interest in web
      development for quite a while now, so I decided to jump in and tackle it head-on.
