    summary: |
      Since I was a child, I have always liked everything that has to do with technology, moreover.
      In third grade I was given the little green ceibalita with antennas and without knowing Python or anything else I edited the games and activities of it. 
      Then in third grade of high school I wanted to study a technological high school and I chose Computer Science, now I intend to continue my education and do a university degree related to this as well.
