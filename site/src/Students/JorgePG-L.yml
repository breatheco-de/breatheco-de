        We did all kind of work in virtual reality, art projects. Probably in that time one of the first virtual reality projects in the art field. And other kinds of marketing projects for different brands.
        In this company we implemented the work in Unreal engine, searching for the best aestethic results. Some of the experiences I developed all by myself, from coding to 3d modelling and textures.
