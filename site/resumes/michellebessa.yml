        For personal reasons, I had to quit Civil Engineering. But my passion for construction was so big I looked for scholarships and got one in a Technician degree for Building construction. My classes were Physics, Algebra, Technical Drawing and Principles of Building Construction. Soon after I started, I moved to Miami and quit the course.

    - degree: Civil Engineering - Bachelor
      university: FMU - Faculdades Metropolinas Unidas (Sao Paulo - Brazil)

        I studied Civil Enginnering for 1 semester, which is equivalent to 6 months in Brazil. That was the first time I had experience with coding, because one of my classes was "computer programming", and I learned C++. I had other classes like Chemistry, Algebra and Analitic Geometry, and Introduction to Engineering.

        link: https://github.com/michellebessa/instagramphotofeed-bootstrap/blob/main/index.html
        tagline: In this project, I was introduced to Bootstrap. I created an Instagram Photo Feed using only Bootstrap commands with CSS and JavaScript styles, such as dropdown buttons, modal window and grid views. In the Photo Feed I displayed two grid views, one with all 6 photos side by side (2 horizontal rows displaying 3 pictures each) and another grid with all 6 photos displayed vertically in a single column.

      - title: Coding an Excuse Generator with Javascript 
        project_logo: https://github.com/breatheco-de/tutorial-project-excuse-generator-javascript/blob/master/explanation.gif?raw=true
        link: https://3000-michellebes-excusegener-2wikxwpj4cw.ws-us63.gitpod.io
        tagline: For this project, I built funtions with Javascript to create an Excuse Generator, in which every time that I refresh the broswer page, a random excuse about my homework is displayed. So the excuses are generated, I applied a function that creates random numbers and connected these functions to the index linked to each part of the phrase that was being generated (such as who, what, when, etc).
