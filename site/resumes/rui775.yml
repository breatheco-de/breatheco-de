    summary: |
      All started with a Zx Spectrum 48k... The passion for IT became from long time ago but life didn't provide me that path. 
      Twenty five years I embraced my first challenge when got back to school and get my first degree in Environmental Managment and after that I took a superior degree in Environmental Engineer, while at that time already working as a freelancer.
      And that's what I've done for more about 15 years and later working in a coordinator role. From two years until now, I started to take some introdutory courses to get into the IT universe. 
      At the same time I have been studying english to improve my skills. This took me to the actual stage where I want to embrace this new challenge, that is to say I intend to change career to became a Full Stack Developer.
