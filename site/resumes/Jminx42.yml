    summary: |
      While I was studying for my Bcom in Marketing Management, I worked as a tutor. Kumon offered extra English and Mathematics lessons for students of various ages. It was a great way for me to earn extra income and gain experience. I was determined to start at the bottom and work my way up wherever I found myself.
      My next step was as a Junior Bookseller at Bargain Books. I learned a lot about customer service and adminstrative tasks that were required running a bookstore. The next venture started out as a personal assistant position at Edublox PE. It evolved into a tutoring position and then into a teaching position. It was a lot of responsibility and it showed me how much I was capable of doing.
      I was offered an opportunity at ATM Solutions as an Operations Coordinator. The title of the position, itself, was daunting. However, I was ready for the challenge.
      I was confident in the skills and processes they taught me. 
      I find myself on a new path into the IT world and all that it holds.

        This position was completely different to what I had done previously. 
        It was definitely a challenge to learn all the roles and responsibilities I had to play.
        However, once I was comfortable in what my role was I could do my work confidently and in turn help others.
        My time with ATM Solutions PE was unfortunately cut short. But I will never forget the experiences and people who helped me learn to do my job efficiently.
