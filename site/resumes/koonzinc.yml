    summary: I've been a full time trader in the equities & crypto markets for 5 years until I've recently grown quite 
      fond of how software & web applications are actually built. This led me down the rabbit hole of software Engineering
      which I dove into head first with HTML & CSS and continued learning from there. Excited to see where this field takes me
      and the opportunities that can come from it.
