    summary: |
      Born and raised in Lisbon, Portugal. Sport is a big part of my life. Helped to get the confidance and have a purpose. 
      I persued the carrer as a coach and a teacher... it was quite a good one, and it is still going. 
      But there was always something in the back of my mind, the future and the love for the digital world.
      Now it is time to learn and make it happen.
