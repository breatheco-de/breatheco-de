    summary: |
      I'm an IT systems engineer and also a bachelor in contemporary music (saxophone performer), highly motivated and goal-oriented IT business analyst and Product Owner with 6+ years of experience in requirements definition, hardware & software and business design/support. Most of my professional life I have worked with different kind of IT teams in classical and agile environments, getting passionate about understanding business problems and removing ambiguity from stakeholders minds. My main goal is to support my team becoming an enabler of their goals.
      I feel passionate about music and movies, get into profound conversations and finding “out of the box” experiences that always make me improve as a human being and become a more empathetic and responsive professional.
      I’ve always focused in developing great communication skills because I love to be a people-oriented guy. I consider myself adjustable to any type of situation, I have worked in small struggling startups and big old fashion companies, always trying to bring the best out of my team, despite of their differences.
