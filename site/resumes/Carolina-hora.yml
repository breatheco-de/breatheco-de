    summary: |
      I am 33 years old, I have a MSc in Chemical Engineering and I've recently 
      finished my PhD degree in Chemical and Biological Engineering, at the UPorto.
      In 2015, I started my research career at Biomark Sensor Research, then I joined LEPABE-FEUP, 
      in 2017,  after receiving a doctoral scholarship.
      Since 2022, I've been employed at Pixel Voltaic, a spin-off company from UPorto, 
      where I'm involved in the R&D, but also as Work Package Leader in Pixel's participation 
      in European projects. Lately, I've been doing websites using WordPress and I've 
      discovered my real love with web developing.
