    summary: |
      I first moved from Graphic Design to Social Media, then e-commerce strategies, and finally to Web Development. The aim is to be able to switch to projects in all phases: concept, research, design and frontend implementation. Enthusiastic about technology and programming. I am in favor of continuous self improvement, good practices, clean code, test-driven development and scrum team-work methodologies.
