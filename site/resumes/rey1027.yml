    summary: |
      I am a very dedicated person, responsible with my duties, in addition to being a sports-active and healthy person, and I enjoy learning new things. Since I was a child, I know that I like the area of technology, so I took the challenge of studying Computer Engineering and learning everything related to web development. In the same way I have a hobby with music.
