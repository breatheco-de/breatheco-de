    summary: |
      About 15th years ago I stared in the tourism industry, in the lowest level of the customer service departament from a luxury hotel
      since that i began to ascend possitions while i was studing the university at distance, when i graduate i get an excecutive position in the company,
      and stared my master degree. When the pandemic arrived there was no tourism so i learned everything about digital marketing so can develope
      my job in that area. at the begining was great, and get important projects and positions in my city, but wasn´t happy for that. I was always
      searching for something else that really like me. Thats how i found Data Science.
