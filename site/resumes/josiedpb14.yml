    summary: |
      I started studying Computer Science due to my much interest in videogames, I had hoped to become
      a videogame developer. But with time and the litle bit of time that I've been in the developing
      world I now find myself much more attracted to web and app developing. I've had courses in University about
      different programming lenguages such as Java, C, Python, CSS, JavaScript and some more. I have experience
      working with databases as well primarly with SQL.

      I'm also taking a course on python,and should hopefully finish it soon, as it is one of the most growing
      developing lenguages in the present.
