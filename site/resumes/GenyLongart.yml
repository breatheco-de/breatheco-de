    summary: |
      Frontend developer with vast knowledge of corporate social communication. 
      If you asked me to describe myself in one word, I would choose "adaptability". 
      I believe that the human being must have the capacity to continuously transform in order to reach his best version. 
      Journalism gave me the necessary communication tools to enhance my social, organizational and teamwork skills, 
      however it was in programming where I discovered that we are capable of generating significant 
      changes from our square meter.
