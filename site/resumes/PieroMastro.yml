  summary: |
    From Medical Sciences to the ever-expanding digital world, I started this journey with something in mind.
    I am giving my professional life a complete overhaul and becoming a Full Stack Developer.
    Since I was a teenager back in the 90s, always had a thing about tech and computers in general,
    I went to Medical School and then moved to Chile to pursue a major in Biomedical Sciences.
    The pandemic struck, and I had a massive change in the way I lived my life, became a dad and I noticed something was missing, I wanted to spend more time with my kids.
    Now I'm looking for an opportunity to work from home and be with my family, keep learning and hopefully find a job that allows me to continue to grow as a father and a developer.
    I'm Honest, hard-working, and trustworthy with a lot of experience working as part of a team and individually, and always hungry for knowledge.
