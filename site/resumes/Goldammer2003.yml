    summary: |
        My coding experience only started, when i signed up for the Full-Stack Software Developer course at 4 Geeks starting at August 2022. 
        For the first month i thus moved to Miami to get as much in person mentorship as possible, before i will do the rest of the work from Germany remotely. 
        I guess learning to code is like entering a new world, but access to these different worldviews is what gives you the creativity to pursue any dreams you have in life.
