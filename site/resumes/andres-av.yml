    # Define yourself in 4-5 words
    motto: After years of experience operating and managing different projects related to volunteering, continuous process improvement and other technical and technological projects, I have become passionate about meeting the highest standards with a detail oriented approach. I find it fulfilling to collaborate in a company where the projects we develop impact positively the lives of others, while keeping sustainability as a priority. 

       I am always looking forward to learning and improving, and I believe constant and meaningful feedback is key when achieving these goals. 

       I am autonomous and self-directed when managing my workload. However I like being a team player and always being eager to help.

    summary: |
      First employed as a Tour Guide in Costa Rica, I have developed great customer service skills. However, lately I have been transitioning to the technological industry, first, by taking 
      advantage of the Career Choice program at Amazon to study project Management, then getting trained in Scrum Master and Agile Methodologies and most recently, becoming a full-stack web developer, I am aiming to
      collaborate in meaningful and challenging programming projects that enhance people's daily lives.
