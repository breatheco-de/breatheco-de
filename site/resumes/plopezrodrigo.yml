    summary: |
      Unlike other profiles, I have not always been clear about the meaning of my professional career. 
      It was time, maturity and effort that determined the path to follow. Since then I have really found
      meaning in those decisions I made when I was only 18 years old.
      When I decided to study journalism, I was not sure what my goal was. A few years later, I have
      realized that communication has always been the common piece of every professional and educational
      experience.
      However, the fact that my career has not been linear has made me become an off-road profile, with an
      awareness of the business world at every single level. Therefore, I have changed my trajectory many
      times and that has only been possible thanks to continuous training. Becasu this is what I really love,
      LEARN AS MUCH AS I CAN AND SQUEZZE EVERY SINGLE EXPERIENCE.
