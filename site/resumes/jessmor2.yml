    summary: |
      I have spent the majority of my working career at Publix Supermarkets. First started there in March of 2011 and moved through positions gaining experience and knowledge along the way. I was a manager for a time before my first daughter was born
       at which time I decided to step down from management so to have a more flexible schedule for my family. After some time as a meat cutter now I am coming to the realization that a retail job and hours is still too strenuous on our family schedule.
        I am pursuing a job in coding as it offers a rapidly growing job field with countless interesting areas of expertise. Going through the 4Geeks Academy Full stack developer Bootcamp has shown me how fun, challenging and rewarding coding truly is. 
        I can't wait to continue learning more and more about coding and eventually land my dream job as a software engineer and get to go coding everyday for a living!
