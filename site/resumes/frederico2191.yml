    summary: |
        I would love to truly integrate my humanistic view of the world with scientific rigor into Web Development. 
        
        I strongly aspire to collaborate with ambitious medical companies in the market offering a detail oriented mind and adiversified skil-set.
        
        Having a medical training background and having practiced as a Medical Doctor, I realized my areas of interest expand much more than the traditional path. 

        I am proactive, creative, analytical and tipically stand out for my leadership and ambition.
        
        I have also become quite keen on Philosophy with a special interest in Phenomenology and Bioethics.
