    summary: |
      I've been working in retail and customer service since 2016 and decided to have a change in career when I got into cars and mechanic work, I started to pursue that career path by getting into car parts sales and trying to start school learning more about mechanics but I was told by the school where I was apoplying that I had to wait until the age of 24 unless I wanted to pay the tuition all upfront. After that I decidede to learn on my own instead of going to school but that prooved too be harder than I thought and I quickly realized i had to change my career path plans so I talked with my wife and a few friends and thats when I decided to pursue coding and thanks to my friend Christian Luperon and with his help and the friendly staff at 4Geeks I was able to start the Bootcamp.
