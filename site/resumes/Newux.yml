    summary: |
      I had a sweet start to my professional career as a marketing manager for Dairy Queen in The Bahamas. After a couple of years, I transitioned into the freight and logistics industry. I have been in freight for 10 + years. During that time I have become a licensed customs broker and developed an appreciation for software that help my businesses scale and be more efficient.

        I enjoyed my time in Halifax studying at Saint Mary's. It was at this univesity where I was introduced to technological side of business. My perspective was changed to technology as a core investment rather than a support function.
