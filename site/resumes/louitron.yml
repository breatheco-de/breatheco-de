    summary: |
      I have been in the live event production industry for the last 7 years. Currently I am an Operations Manager for one of the largest production companies in the world. I've always loved
      technology and figuring out how things work. I am passionate about learning about A.I. and machine learning models and am working on transitioning to a career that would allow me to explore
      those interests in a working capacity and make my contribution. In my spare time, I love to make music, which is what I originally studied. I also love spending time with my 12 year old puppy,
      and designing/3D printing cool gadgets.
