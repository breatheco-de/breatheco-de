      Systems Engineering at UNIMET allows me to acquire some abilities and to take my first steps 
      as a programmer, acquiring the knowledge required for understanding the logic applied to
      this area. Also, that helps me face a lot of challenges and problems in which it was 
      necessary to look for and implement the best possible solution.
