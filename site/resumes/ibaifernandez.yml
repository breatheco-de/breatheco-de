  motto: |
    'Nulla dies sine linea'

    'Nulla dies sine linea' is a Latin phrase meaning “no day without a single line”. It finds its source
    in Pliny the Elder (Natural History, XXXV, 84), where the idea applies to the Greek painter Apelles,
    who did not go a day without drawing at least one line. But it is only in the “Proverbiorum libellus”
    by Polydore Vergil (1470-1555) in which the phrase itself is attested for the first time.

  focus: |
    Organized and motivated employee specially focused on time management, capable of working under pressure
    in many different environments. Seeking to join an organization where I can make the best out of my potential,
    contributing to the organization's growth, as the organization contributes to mine.

  summary: |
    Highly versatile entrepreneur with 9+ years of experience in setting up self-sustainable businesses and partaking
    in corporate environments. Responsible for planning and directing daily operations, coming up with new ideas,
    managing conflicts, supervision, sales, customer service, and marketing.

    Always with the most positive attitude and ready to help others along the same path that I have chosen, I have
    created my theoretical business model, regarding which I am always open to performing any adjustments necessary
    based on each venture's particular needs.

    Used to working outside the typical workdays, the strongest parts of my skill set are related to time management,
    project managing (both planning and decision making), and leadership (for which a strong sense of communication
    always comes in quite handy).
