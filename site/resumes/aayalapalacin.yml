  summary: "I began an Accounting career while still in High School thanks to our \"May Project\" progam. This allowed all seniors to skip school for the month of May and get an internshhip instead. At the completion of my internship, I was offered a position as the Ar/Ap clerk. I contnued for 2 years while going to college, before moving into a Budget Analyst role for the NYS Department of Health. Following a brief stint there, for about a year, I was lucky enough to accept an offer as an Accoutning Manager for a privately owend company in NY. I completed my degree in Finance, while working as an Accounting Manager over the next 2+ years; and eventually saved enough money to quit and move to Miami. Upon arriving in Miami almost 2 years ago, I accepted another accounting Job for a public company. A year later, I decided I'd had enough of Accounting and took a job with Robert Half as the Client Service Director for the Southeast region. While working at Robert Half is when I decided to dive into coding/programming and really diversify my skillset."
