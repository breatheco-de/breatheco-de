    summary: |
      It is well known that what allows us to evolve is not the strength we possess, but the ability to adapt.      
      Throughout my professional years I have dedicated myself to different sectors within the production, marketing and software development, 
      thereby achieving a high professional plasticity and a very broad and innovative vision of business and entrepreneurship.
      With a safe, reliable and empathetic character, I can add a differential link to the chain that I incorporate.
