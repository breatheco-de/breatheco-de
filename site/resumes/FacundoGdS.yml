    summary: |
        I have just finished a Bachelor's degree in Communication, in the course of which I have leaned towards the world of programming and technology. 
        
        The main topic of my thesis focused on the application of Artificial Intelligence in journalism and automated news generation. 
        
        For this and other reasons I have decided to make a pivotal change in my education to catch up with the technological-industrial revolution and become more literate.
