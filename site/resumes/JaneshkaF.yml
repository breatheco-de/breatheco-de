      details: |
        After the previous experience I had from assisting and working behind the chair, I was able to come in fully working behind the chair. 
        This included all responsibilities stated in my prior job as well as new opportunities. At this point, I am able to be at more of a 
        self employed/management role. This entails more responsibilities such as confirming appointments, making check up calls, helping replenish
        inventory, and educate fellow stylists with new techniques.

    - role: Hairstylist
      time: 2012 - 2016
      company: Rockspa Salon
      details: |
        While working at this salon, i began assisting and worked my way to working behind the chair. As an assistant, i was required
        to assist with washing hair, prepping clients, and helping keep workflow of salon organized by communicating with coworkers.
        Once I startred working behind the chair, although some responsibilities stayed the same, others changed.
        I now became fully responsible for each client I came in contact with in regards to performing color services such as balayage, highlights,
        and base colors. As well as chemical services such as Keratin. All of this required years of pratice to perfect. Their is alot of
        communication and understanding needed between the client, the front desk, assistants, and myself to ensure services are executed in 
        a professional and timely manner.
