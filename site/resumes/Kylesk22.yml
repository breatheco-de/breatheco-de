    summary: |
      After 10 years in the hospitality industry I am ready for my next venture in life. Throughout my career I have continually grown in roles through dedication to learning my craft. Starting out as a food-runner at a WaterPark I worked through every possible front of house role until I was the manager of multiple restaurants. My goal is to take this same dedication and apply it to a career that better suits my skill sets and creates better opportunities for my family.
