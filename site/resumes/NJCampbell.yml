Career Profile: My journey began as a pharmacy technician for Walgreens. I advanced quickly and was recognized for my leadership skills which
                opened up opportunities for promotion where I assisted the District Pharmacy Operations Manager in training, educating, and driving
                performance. I missed having a connection with my patients so I left that position to return to store level and brought my knowledge and 
                experience to deliver excellent patient care and elevate our store to exceed all expectations. Ultimately this career path was not a good fit for 
                me and I chose to leave and move into the IT world where I worked as Remote Service Technician for Pomeroy. I was exposed to a large variety
                of systems and hardware from the numerous clients we serviced. I developed my skills in networking, hardware and software troubleshooting and 
                installation, and project deployment. Making this changeover from healthcare to IT has given me the confidence to pursue my passion of 
                software development. I look forward to seeing what the future holds.
