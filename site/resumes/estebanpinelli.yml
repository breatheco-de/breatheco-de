    summary: I have worked as a travel agent for several years in the tourism industry, helping clients plan and organize their trips efficiently and effectively. During this time, I have developed skills in managing reservations, selling tour packages, customer service, and knowledge of popular tourist destinations.
            However, I have recently realized that my true passion is programming. For some time now, I have been interested in the world of technology and software development, and I have come to the decision that I want to change careers in order to explore this area more deeply.
            I have started studying programming on my own, taking online courses and reading books on the subject. I am excited about the idea of learning new programming languages and creating programs that can have a real impact on people's lives.
            While changing careers can be challenging, I am determined to move forward and do whatever it takes to learn programming and find work in this field. I am excited about the idea of working in a creative and collaborative environment, and I hope that my previous experience in tourism can be useful in my new career in technology.
