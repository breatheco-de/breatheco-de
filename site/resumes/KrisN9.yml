    summary: |
      After studying a law degree and master's programmes, I worked as an Administrative Assistant in a shipping agency for more than 5 years.
      I tried some free programming courses just for entertainment. I had so much fun, and this fact made me decide to give Full-Stack development a try, 
      as well as choosing 4Geeks Academy bootcamp.
