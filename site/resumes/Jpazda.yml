    summary: |
      After graduating from Kennesaw State University in 2019 with a Bachelors in Finance, I have worked in Accounting from 2019-2023. While working in Accounting, I began learning to code for fun in my free time. After alot of thought and consideration, I decided to pursue a full time career in software developing, as I find it much more mentally stimulating and rewarding than Accounting.
