  summary: I am a passionate geographer with a strong interest in the application of informatics in the geospatial domain. Throughout my career, I have combined my love for geography with skills in information technology, allowing me to explore and fully leverage the potential of geographic information systems (GIS) and computer tools.
    My focus revolves around utilizing technology to analyze and gain a better understanding of spatial patterns and interactions in the world around us. I have gained experience in managing geographic databases, creating maps, and visualizing geospatial data, as well as analyzing and interpreting geographic information to make informed decisions.
    Furthermore, I have collaborated on projects related to the weekly and monthly monitoring of activities in the natural environment, conducting surveys, data analysis, and the development of Environmental Management Plans (EMPs). I have also worked with environmental remote sensing technologies and land use to extract valuable information and contribute to decision-making in the environmental field.
    My primary objective is to apply my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions that contribute to sustainable development.
