       I possess 1 year and a half of teaching experience with the English languange. 
       Most of my work was teaching a personal and small number of students. 
       Thanks to this, I was able to attend their educational needs much better than I could with a large classroom. 
       I have worked with small kids (youngest I can think of was 8), teenagers, and professional adults. 
       Furthermore, most of adults that were taught by me had a 1 on 1 teaching class. 
       They received educational programs mostly related to the financial sector. What I did the most with teenagers was academic in nature regarding the teaching subjects. 
       Thus, I possess a bit of experience teaching a wide range of topics to different age groups.
