    summary: |
      Allow me to introduce myself as Alexis Rose Polowsky, a full time student at Florida 
      International University, Miami. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer 
      Science (CS). I have a dual major in Electronics Engineering Technology (EET) and 
      Computer and Information Science (CIS). I am expected to graduate FIU by the end of May
      2024. I joined Coyne College, Chicago, after High School and obtained an Associate Degree 
      in Electrical Construction. Later, I secured admission at East-West University & then FIU. 
      During my education after High School, I worked several jobs as an Electrical Tutor at Coyne, 
      AutoCAD Drafter, Panda Express PIC, Project Manager, and as a TV- show Artist in the Chicago 
      land area. 
      
      When I decided to enroll at East-West University. I applied for TA ship position and 
      I was hired. As Teacher Assistant in the Electronics Engineering department, I had great experience 
      learning both fundamentals and subtle aspects of subject matter. I also had valuable laboratory 
      experience in Analog, Digital, Filter Design, and Communications. Fortunately, despite my schedule, 
      I maintained a GPA of 3.8 out of 4.0. I have taken several relevant programming courses in
      programming, such as, C# I , C# II, Java I , JAVA II, Web Page Design, AutoCAD, and Digital
      Multi Media Courses. I am currently taking a part time class in 4Geeks while working full time as a
      Project Manager for an Engineering Firm.
