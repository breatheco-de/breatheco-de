    summary: |
      I have been in the marketing world for almost 5 years now and have realized that coding and software development plays a huge roll
      in a large majority of the services my clients need. I took it upon myself to dive into this space and hopefully become proficient 
      in coding to grow my tool belt to help more people. Eventually my plan is to have a good understanding of coding in order to create and manage
      a department in my company for coding services.
