  summary: >
    Recent 4Geeks Academy bootcamp grad where I gained robust experience in
    technologies such as JavaScript, ReactJs, NodeJs, Bootstrap, Python, Flask,
    Rest APIs, SQL, and Git. Gained collaboration experience with teachers,
    mentors and fellow classmates debugging various code, working on solving the
    problems as a team. Created many different projects involving both front and
    back end. I enjoy implementing visual layouts and building new dynamic
    API's, creating a smooth and prolific user experience. You can check out all
