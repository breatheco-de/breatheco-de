    summary: |
      I originally started my career as a graphic designer, but didn't quite find it to be a good fit for me. I had always done very simple HTML in my work, but I never did a deep dive. In 2022 I was looking for a change, and decided to revisit coding with 4Geeks Academy. I'm already learning a lot, and the process of solving problems and seeing your code work is already so satisfying.

      Outside of work, I have a passion for voice acting, and hope to do some work in animation/video games one day.
