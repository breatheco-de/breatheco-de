    summary: |
      I graduated from University of Costa Rica with a degree in Nutrition, and realized that even though I am passionate about food and nutrition, it was not the career path I wanted. I spent 2 years working in a travel agency and became supervisor of a team until I had a baby and decided to stay home with him. 7 years and 2 more babies later I was certain I wanted to make a move towards programming which is something that I had been feeling drawn to for a few years and had been studying off and on from different free online resources. I finally enrolled in 4Geeks Academy and discovered I love programming even more than I imagined and am excited to move forward on this path.
