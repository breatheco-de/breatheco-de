    summary: |
      I'm originally from Chile, but I have lived abroad for more than 10 years now. 
      During the past 10+ years I have lived in New Zealand, Australia, Brazil and 
      Spain, where I'm currently living. I speak 4 languages (Spanish, English, 
      Portuguese and French) and have a journalist degree. I worked for 
      Thomson-Reuters, the world's biggest news agency, as a sub-editor in the 
      Economy and Treasuries Section. After a few years, I decided that journalism 
      wasn't really my passion, so I decided to travel and explore new possibilities 
      in life. 
      
      During my years in Brazil I founded and developed two succesfull businesses in 
      the hospitality industry, and currently in Barcelona I'm developing 
      an ecommerce platform to sell CBD products for the EU market. 
      Since a few years I have been intrigued and looking into pursuing a carrer on 
      tech as I feel that with my background and experience I could bring a different 
      approach to solving real life issues while offering new technological solutions 
      for businesses in the digital world.
