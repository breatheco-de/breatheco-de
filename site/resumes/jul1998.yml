    summary: |
      I considered myself as someone earnest and diligent who not only has a big passion for learning, but also can take on challenges and solve problems; learn new technologies and skills quickly, and create an exceptional experience for customers of any kind.
      Also, I have had previous job experiences where I had to meet business targets with good outcomes, keep an efficient communication with internal and external stakeholders in order to help our customers in either English or Portuguese; and have a bias for action with my peers to always improve my organization in any way.
