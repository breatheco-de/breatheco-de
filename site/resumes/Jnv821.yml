    summary: |
      I always liked Videogames and that's what brought a passion for coding.
      I've been dealing with computes for a long time. I've written code snippets that improve significantlly the workflow of refurbishing PCs.
      I plan to be a part of the VideoGame creating process as a way to give back to what brought me so much joy in the past.
