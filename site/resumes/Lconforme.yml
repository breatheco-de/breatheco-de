    summary: |
      How I got to my current career, is I started to exercise and wanted to lose weight. 
      It became an addiction on the confidence I built for myself. Teaching others the same way I
      was taught was also something that I knew was meant for me to carry on the knowledge. When I
      started to count macros my knowledge expanded even further. I was able to eat more, as well as
      also eat healthy dishes. The more creative I became, the more I wanted to cook. Which is also
      another passion of mine.
