    motto: Coder
    summary: I've worked various jobs throughout my life and earlier this year of 2022 my best friend really got me interested into learning coding. 
      I started just by going on free coding websites and learning languages like Python.
      I then looked into ways I could be succesful with learning how to code and I found 4Geeks Academy! 
      So far I really like the program and I really appreciate all of the support from such great people!

      details: I would have everything prepared for loading whatever truck I'm assigned to do that day 
       and I would load up the back of a good sized box truck with produce and specialty foods to 
       deliver to many restaurants throughout that day. 
       I would also sometimes have to help box up the food and help prepare for other drivers including 
       myself depending on how busy the company was in general on certain days.
