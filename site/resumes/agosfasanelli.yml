    summary: |
        I dedicated my life to coding since I was 13 years old, today I'm fortunate to make a living building and teaching code to everyone throughout my different business endeavors:
        
        First I founded 4Geeks Developers Community: At the company, we built and launched 50 tech products during 10 years mainly focused in LatinAmerican markets. We opened offices in 7 different countries, 300 employees and more than $8,000,000 in revenues.
        
        4Geeks Academy: Coding academy with 700+ alumni worldwide, ~90% of the graduates had an average 20% increase in salary after completing the program. $1,000,000+ in annual revenues in 6 locations.
        
        BreatheCode: Not-for-profit open source community aiming to accelerate the way junior developers learn and evolve using technology.
