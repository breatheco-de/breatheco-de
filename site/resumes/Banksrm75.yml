        My Elementary Education degree taught me about collaboration and persistance. I learned how to evaluate and adapt quickly to meet the needs
        and challenges surrounding me. I graduated with a Minor in Special Education. This started my love of tailoring solutions to unique challenges.

        Based on the needs of the other trades at the refinery, my team would build a scaffolding to allow them to access an area of the refinery. My team 
        needed to coordinate with all the trades so that we were not hindering another trade's work while assisting one trade in theirs. Often there were 
        structures and sensitive equipment in the path of an ideal scaffold structure, so there was a lot of creative-thinking and problem-solving required.

          - Using customer requirements to build scaffolding
          - Modifying scaffolding based on changing customer needs

    - role: Administrative Assistant

        I was in charge of monitoring the hours worked and the hours of training completed by each apprentice and create reports and corresponding letters to 
        the apprentices, their places of employment, the State Department, and the training center's board. I would maintain a physical file and a digital 
        database to track each apprentice's progress and the resulting reports and letters generated.

          - Ensure compliance with the state and federal requirements for the Construction Laborers' Apprenticeship programs
          - Evaluate and revise procedures to improve office efficiency

        I was in the Nursing Division of the College. I proctored the suite of assessments each student needed to take and analyzed the data on student 
        performance. I maintained the database of students to reflect their compliance with the immunization requirements and minimum level of performance on 
        the required assessments. 

          - Monitor digital document database and update Excel spreadsheet to reflect the students' level of compliance with the immunization requirements
          - Evaluate and revise procedures to improve office efficiency

        I spent years honing my project management skills. Predicting all the things that students would struggle with and putting scaffolding in place to 
        support their problem-solving skills. I became skilled at assessing each student's areas of strenghts and areas for growth. I facilitated 
        small-group learning activities to meet all of their unique needs. I collaborated with the other adults around them and coordinated support-services 
        so each student could succeed. As plans did not go according to design, I would quickly evaluate and adapt.
