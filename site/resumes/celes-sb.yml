  summary: >
    I am new in the world of programming. But I am not new at diving into
    deep changes in my life. After learning on my own for a few months I made
    the decision to enrol in 4Geeks Academy Bootcamp program to learn properly
    and in a collaborative environment where I can acquire all the necessary
    skills to insert myself in the job market.

    I am focused on being the best developer I can be. Discipline and determination are on my side.
