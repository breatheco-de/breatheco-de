  summary: |
    I obtained my B.S. degree in Industrial Technologies Engineering from the University Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M) in 2020. Prior to completing my studies, I was selected for the Research Initiation Fellowship program at the IMDEA Materials Institute, where I was involved in the reserach on the quenching and partitioning processing of martensitic stainless steels. Following my B.S. degree, I pursued further studies and received an M.Sc. degree in Material Science and Engineering from UC3M in 2021 as a scholarship holder. During my master's program, I focused on the thermo-mechanical characterization of γ-TiAl intermetallics in collaboration with the IMDEA Materials Institute. I also gained practical experience as a trainee at the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN), where I contributed to the study of hydroforming of superconductive radiofrequency copper cavities. I have co-authored two peer-reviewed articles, one book chapter, one conference paper and one paper under reviewing.Since 2022, I have been working as a Project Associate at CERN, as a member of the Cable Ageing REsearch (CARE) project, which investigates the degradation of cables polymeric components caused by radiation exposure. Recently, I have startedto further expand into the world of programming as a student of the Full-Stack developer bootcamp at 4GeeksAcademy in order to boost my professional profile as well as to continue embracing new adventures.
